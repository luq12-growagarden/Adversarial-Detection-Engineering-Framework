- ✅ Get ahead of False Negatives by understanding how detection logic fails before threat actors abuse them
- ✅ Identify reproducible detection logic bugs and map them to formal ADE categories
- ✅ Embed an attacker’s mental model into how detection logic is designed and reviewed
- ✅ Expose structural weaknesses in rules used for hunts or production MDR tooling (SIEM, XDR, EDR)
- ✅ Equip red teams and detection engineers with actionable detection logic bug intelligence


## What is Adversarial Detection Engineering (ADE)?

Adversarial Detection Engineering (ADE) is the discipline of reasoning about False Negatives in detection rules on a per rule basis. These False Negatives are the result of bugs in detection logic, that is, mismatches between *what a detection rule is intended to identify* and *how its logic actually implements that intention*.

The ADE Framework provides a modern open source formalization of Detection Logic Bugs, including definitions, a taxonomy, and concrete examples drawn from multiple vendor and open source rulesets.

With ADE, instead of waiting for real world False Negatives to show, a detection engineer can iterate over a taxonomy of logic bugs, asking:

 *“What variations would cause this rule's detection logic to miss what it was intended to catch?”*.

This adversarial line of reasoning mirrors how threat actors abuse weaknesses in detection logic.

**The ADE Framework provides**:
- **A Theory of Detection Logic Bugs**, with specific definitions to be used consistently.

- **A Formal Taxonomy of Bug classes**, derived from analysis of multiple open-source rulesets, with clear terminology and categorization.

- **Concrete examples of rule bypasses resulting from logic bugs**. to help defenders recognize and reason about potential False Negatives before threat actors do.

## ADE Detection Logic Bug Taxonomy

The full taxonomy consists of 4 categories, and 11 sub-categories, each including an example of a bug and it's resulting False Negative that can occur if abused.

```
🌳 ADE1 – Reformatting in Actions
    └─ ADE1-01 Substring Manipulation
🌳 ADE2 – Omit Alternatives
    ├─ ADE2-01 API/Function
    ├─ ADE2-02 Versioning
    ├─ ADE2-03 Locations
    └─ ADE2-04 File Types
🌳 ADE3 – Context Development
    ├─ ADE3-01 Process Cloning
    ├─ ADE3-02 Aggregation Hijacking
    └─ ADE3-03 Timing and Scheduling
🌳 ADE4 – Logic Manipulation
    ├─ ADE4-01 Gate Inversion
    ├─ ADE4-02 Conjunction Inversion
    └─ ADE4-03 Incorrect Expression
```


## Extend to Existing Detection Engineering Framework

ADE complements existing detection engineering frameworks, such as Kunal Hatode (Ke0xe)'s Detection Engineering Lifecycle Phases. In particular, the ['Improvement Phase'](https://github.com/Ke0xes/Detection-Engineering-Framework/blob/main/improvement-phase.md) emphasizes identifying gaps in detection rules.  

ADE provides a **formal lens to reason about Detection Logic Bugs** within this phase, offering a structured way to classify potential rule weaknesses and understand sources of False Negatives.

## ADE's Focus

ADE is specifically concerned with **Detection Logic Bugs**, instances where the logic of a detection rule contradicts its intended purpose, resulting in **rule-specific False Negatives**.

Other issues that may affect a detection rule, but are outside ADE’s scope, include:
- **Data Quality Issues:** Required signals are missing, unreliable, or inconsistent, leading to weak or incomplete detection coverage.  
- **Tuning Issues:** Detection logic is overly broad or “greedy,” which may cause false positives but is not a logic bug.

### Current Opportunities for Contributors

We are looking for contributors to help expand and improve the ADE Framework. Areas of active development include:
- Static Analyzer Development: Tools to analyze detection rules for potential logic bugs, designed for use in Detection-as-Code CI/CD pipelines or IDEs.
- Bug Repository Expansion: A curated collection of identified detection logic bugs, along with their resulting False Negatives, drawn from multiple open-source and vendor rulesets.

Contributions can range from coding and tooling to documentation, examples, and taxonomy refinement.

## How to Use ADE

ADE is designed to help detection engineers and security researchers reason about False Negatives. Recommended usage:

1. **Read the Theory & Taxonomy** to understand bug classes.  
2. **Map your rules or queries** against the taxonomy to identify potential logic weaknesses.  
3. **Document observations** in your own improvement process or detection engineering framework.  


## Related Work / References

ADE builds on and complements existing work in detection engineering, threat modeling and security analytics. While many frameworks focus on coverage, operational workflow, or rule formatting, **ADE is unique in formalizing logic-level causes of False Negatives**.

Some related work:
1. [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) provides context for attacks but does not formally classify logic failures in detection rules.
2. [MITRE CAR (Cyber Analytics Repository)](https://car.mitre.org/) provides a collection of detection analytics and queries for SIEM/XDR systems. CAR is rule focused, but does not provide a theory or taxonomy of detection logic bugs.
3. [Detection Engineering Lifecycle by Kunal Hatode (Ke0xe)](https://github.com/Ke0xes/Detection-Engineering-Framework) defines phases of detection engineering, including “Improvement.” ADE provides a complementary lens for reasoning about logic level gaps within this phase.
4. Numerous academic papers discuss IDS/EDR rule quality, anomaly detection and signature evaluation (e.g., false positives/negatives). ADE differs by focusing on formal logic-level bug classification rather than statistical performance or tuning issues.

ADE fills a critical gap by providing a theory, taxonomy and examples of detection logic bugs, thus enabling defenders to proactively reason about False Negatives in ways that existing frameworks and rule repositories do not.
