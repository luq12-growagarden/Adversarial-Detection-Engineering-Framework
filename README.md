**Get ahead of False Negatives** by understanding how detection logic fails before threat actors abuse it.

## What Is ADE?

Adversarial Detection Engineering (ADE) is the discipline of reasoning about **False Negatives in detection rules** on a per-rule basis. The ADE Framework provides a modern open-source formalization of **Detection Logic Bugs** - mismatches between what a detection rule *intends* to detect and what it *actually* detects.

### The ADE Advantage

Instead of waiting for real-world False Negatives, detection engineers can proactively ask:

> *"What variations would cause this rule's detection logic to miss what it was intended to catch?"*

This adversarial line of reasoning mirrors how threat actors abuse weaknesses in detection logic.

## Key Features

- ✅ **Identify reproducible detection logic bugs** and map them to formal ADE categories
- ✅ **Embed an attacker's mental model** into how detection logic is designed and reviewed
- ✅ **Expose structural weaknesses** in rules used for hunts or production MDR tooling (SIEM, XDR, EDR)
- ✅ **Equip red teams and detection engineers** with actionable detection logic bug intelligence
- ✅ **Get ahead of False Negatives** before threat actors discover and exploit them

## ADE link to Detection Logic Exposures (DLE)

- ADE supplies a canonical taxonomy and bug classes for detection logic bugs.
- [DLE](https://github.com/NikolasBielski/Detection-Logic-Exposures) provides a recognized list of publically disclosed bypasses with ADE mappings.

## ADE Detection Logic Bug Taxonomy

The framework identifies **4 major categories** and **12 subcategories** of detection logic bugs:

```
🌳 ADE1 – Reformatting in Actions
    └─ ADE1-01 Substring Manipulation

🌳 ADE2 – Omit Alternatives
    ├─ ADE2-01 API/Function
    ├─ ADE2-02 Versioning
    ├─ ADE2-03 Locations
    └─ ADE2-04 File Types

🌳 ADE3 – Context Development
    ├─ ADE3-01 Process Cloning
    ├─ ADE3-02 Aggregation Hijacking
    ├─ ADE3-03 Timing and Scheduling
    └─ ADE3-04 Event Fragmentation

🌳 ADE4 – Logic Manipulation
    ├─ ADE4-01 Gate Inversion
    ├─ ADE4-02 Conjunction Inversion
    └─ ADE4-03 Incorrect Expression
```

## What the Framework Provides

### 1. Theory of Detection Logic Bugs

[Formal definitions](docs/theory/detection-logic-bugs.md) and theoretical foundation:
- What constitutes a detection logic bug
- How bugs create False Negatives
- Relationship between scope and detection logic
- Concept of Rule Bypasses

### 2. Formal Bug Taxonomy

[Comprehensive classification](docs/taxonomy/overview.md) with clear terminology:
- 4 major categories
- 12 detailed subcategories
- Consistent labeling system (ADE1-01, ADE2-01, etc.)
- Mapping to real-world detection rules

### 3. Real-World Examples

Concrete examples from production rulesets:
- **[Sigma](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma)** detection rules
- **[Microsoft Sentinel](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel)** analytics
- **[Elastic Security](https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules)** SIEM & EDR rules

**Example Categories:**
- [ADE1 Examples](examples/ade1/) - String manipulation bypasses
- [ADE2 Examples](examples/ade2/) - Omitted alternatives
- [ADE3 Examples](examples/ade3/) - Context development attacks
- [ADE4 Examples](examples/ade4/) - Logic manipulation

### 4. Practical Tools

- **[Bug Likelihood Test](docs/guides/bug-likelihood-test.md)** - Quick pre-analysis checklist
- **[Quick Start Guide](docs/getting-started/quick-start.md)** - Step-by-step application process

## How ADE Complements Existing Frameworks

ADE integrates with and enhances existing detection engineering practices:

| Framework | Focus | ADE Integration |
|:----------|:------|:----------------|
| **[MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/)** | Attack techniques & tactics | ADE explains *why* detection fails for ATT&CK techniques |
| **[MITRE CAR](https://car.mitre.org/)** | Detection analytics repository | ADE provides bug taxonomy for CAR analytics |
| **[Detection Engineering Lifecycle](https://github.com/Ke0xes/Detection-Engineering-Framework)** | Engineering workflow phases | ADE is the reasoning framework for the **Improvement Phase** |
| **Sigma/YARA/KQL** | Rule syntax & formatting | ADE analyzes *semantic logic bugs* across all query languages |

**ADE's unique value:** Formal logic-level classification of False Negative causes
